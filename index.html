<h2 class="example">Intro</h2>
<br>
<p class="mainp1">Hi! We are John Cyler Gutierrez and John Miccoh Reyes from 8-Pearl. This is our Intergrative Performance Task on Mathematics and ICT, which consists of four parts: Definition of Relation and Function, Domain and Range, Dependent and Independent Variables, and Graph of Linear Function. Aside from that, we will develop this performance task using an HTML website.</p>
<br><br><hr class="bodyline"><br>
<h2 class="example">Definition of Relation and Function</h2>
<br>
<p class="mainp">In mathematics, a relation is a set of ordered pairs connecting elements from two sets, while a function is a specific type of relation where each element in the domain uniquely maps to an element in the codomain. For example, in the relation R between sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5} defined by {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4)}, the domain is {1, 2, 3}, and the codomain is {4, 5}. In contrast, a function, such as f: A â†’ B with f(x) = x^2 for A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 4, 9}, ensures a one-to-one correspondence between inputs and unique outputs. While relations encompass general connections, functions specifically guarantee uniqueness, finding applications across various mathematical disciplines.</p>
<br><br><hr class="bodyline"><br>
<h2 class="example">Domain and Range</h2>
<br>
<p class="mainp">In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of all possible input values for which the function is defined. It represents the independent variable's permissible values. The range, on the other hand, is the set of all possible output values that the function can produce corresponding to the elements in the domain. In essence, the domain and range define the scope of a function by specifying the acceptable input values and the resulting output values, respectively. Together, they provide a comprehensive understanding of the mapping between elements in the domain to their corresponding images in the range, forming a fundamental aspect of function analysis and representation.</p>
<br><br><hr class="bodyline"><br>
<h2 class="example">Dependent and Independent Variables</h2>
<br>
<p class="mainp">In mathematical relationships, the independent variable is the input or the variable that is manipulated or chosen freely. It is the variable that determines or influences the values of the dependent variable. The dependent variable, on the other hand, is the output or the variable that is observed or measured. Its values depend on the values of the independent variable. In summary, the independent variable is the cause or input, while the dependent variable is the effect or output, and their relationship is crucial in understanding and modeling various phenomena across different disciplines, including mathematics, science, and social sciences.</p>
<br><br><hr class="bodyline"><br>
<h2 class="example">Graph of Linear Function</h2>
<br>
<p class="mainp">The graph of a linear equation in two variables, typically represented on a coordinate plane, is a straight line. Such equations are expressed in the form y = mx + b, where "m" is the slope of the line, and "b" is the y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The slope determines the steepness of the line, with a positive slope indicating an upward slant, a negative slope indicating a downward slant, and a zero slope resulting in a horizontal line. The y-intercept represents the value of y when x is zero. Linear equations and their graphs are fundamental in mathematics, providing a visual representation of relationships between two variables that exhibit constant rates of change.</p>
